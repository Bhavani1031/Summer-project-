#CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
Credit card frauds are easy and friendly targets. E-commerce and many other online sites have increased the online payment modes, increasing the risk for online frauds. Increase in fraud rates, researchers started using different machine learning methods to detect and analyse frauds in online transactions.
Machine learning is effective in determining which transactions are fraudulent and those that are legitimate.The Logistic Regression (LR) classifier, sometimes referred to as the Logit classifier, is a supervised ML method that is generally used for binary classification tasks
Decision Tree (DT) is a supervised ML based approach that is utilized to solve regression and classification tasks.
 A DT contains the following types of nodes: root node, decision node and leaf node. The root node is the starting point of the algorithm. 
The decision node is a point whereby a choice is made in order to split the tree. A leaf node represents a final decision
